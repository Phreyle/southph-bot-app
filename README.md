---

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A Discord application + bot ([Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.Example` to `.env` and fill in real values - **never commit `.env`** (it's gitignored):

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_ID` | Yes | Your Discord application ID |
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Yes | Your bot's token (Bot tab in the Developer Portal) |
| `PUBLIC_KEY` | Yes | Your application's public key, used to verify incoming interaction requests |
| `DATA_DIR` | No | Where per-guild JSON data is stored. Defaults to `/home/container/data` (matches the Pelican egg layout). Set this to a local path (e.g. `./data`) for local development |
| `PORT` | No | Port the Express server listens on for the `/interactions` webhook. Defaults to `3000` |

### 3. Register slash commands

```bash
npm run register
```

Run this again any time you add or change a slash command definition in `commands.js`. It can take a few minutes for Discord to propagate command changes.

### 4. Configure the Interactions Endpoint URL

This bot receives slash commands, buttons, and modals over an **HTTP webhook**, not the Discord gateway. In the Developer Portal, under your application's **General Information**, set **Interactions Endpoint URL** to:

```
https://<your-public-host>/interactions
```

Discord will only deliver interactions to whichever transport is configured here - if this is set, the gateway will not also receive them. The bot still keeps a gateway connection open (`app.js`), but only for `messageCreate` (prefix commands) and the member/guild cache.

### 5. Run the bot

```bash
npm start        # production
npm run dev      # local dev, auto-restarts on change (nodemon)
```

### Docker / Pelican deployment

`Dockerfile.pelican` is the image actually built and pushed by CI (`.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`, tagged `pelican-latest` on Docker Hub) - it follows Pelican's `container` user + `tini` conventions and expects the app's persistent data volume mounted at whatever `DATA_DIR` resolves to (defaults to `/home/container/data`).

Pushing to `main` only builds and publishes a new image - it does **not** auto-restart the running Pelican server. Pull the new image and restart the container manually (or via Pelican's own auto-update settings) to actually deploy a change.

### Required bot permissions

- View Channels
- Send Messages
- Embed Links
- Manage Channels (ticket system creates/deletes channels)
- Manage Roles (Albion registration, ticket approval)
- Manage Nicknames (Albion registration, ticket approval)
- Create Threads / Manage Threads (content callouts, regear)
- Read Message History

## Data & Storage

There is no database - all persistence is flat JSON files under `DATA_DIR`, one set per guild:

| File | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `prefix-config-{guildId}.json` | `src/database/guildData.js` | Custom command prefix (default `!`) |
| `permissions-config-{guildId}.json` | `src/database/guildData.js` | Role lists allowed to manage bank/CTA/content |
| `albion-config-{guildId}.json` | `src/systems/albion/albion-db.js` | Guild/region/role/nickname-format configuration |
| `albion-users-{guildId}.json` | `src/systems/albion/albion-db.js` | Registered members |
| `bank-data-{guildId}.json` | `src/systems/bank/bank.js` | Virtual currency balances |
| `guilds/{guildId}/{tickets,transcripts,panels,meta}.json` | `src/systems/ticket/ticket-db.js` | Ticket system state |

All writes go through a temp-file-then-rename pattern (`src/utils/atomicFile.js`, and `ticket-db.js`'s own async version), so a crash or forced restart mid-write can't leave one of these files truncated. **Back these files up regularly** - they're the only copy of guild configuration, balances, and ticket history.

### Admin Commands

**Albion verification**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/set guild <region> <name>` | Configure guild and region |
| `/set register-role @role` | Role given to verified members |
| `/set guild-tag <tag>` | Guild tag used in nicknames |
| `/set nickname-format <format>` | Nickname template (`{ign}`, `{tag}`, `{guild}`, `{region}`) |
| `/set alliance-role @role` | Alliance registration role |
| `/set alliance-role-enabled <true\|false>` | Toggle alliance role assignment |
| `/set alliance-nickname-format <format>` | Alliance nickname template (`{allianceTag}`, `{allianceName}`, `{playerName}`) |
| `/set alliance-nickname-enabled <true\|false>` | Toggle alliance nickname updates |
| `/set alliance-nickname-overwrite <true\|false>` | Overwrite existing nickname on re-register |
| `/forceunregister <ign>` | Force-unregister a member by IGN |
| `/purge type:guild confirm:true` | Re-verify every guild-registered member against the Albion API and remove anyone no longer in the guild (including members who hold the role but were never registered at all) |
| `/purge type:alliance confirm:true` | Re-verify every alliance-registered member and remove anyone no longer in the guild's current alliance (same manually-assigned-role handling as guild purge) |
| `/registered [type:all\|guild\|alliance]` (or `!registered [all\|guild\|alliance]`) | List every registered member with their linked Albion IGN, grouped by type |

If an alliance tag is missing, alliance name is used instead; if both are missing, the nickname falls back to player name only.

**Alliance verification is automatic, not configured.** `type:alliance` registration and `/purge type:alliance` both look up the configured guild's (`/set guild`) *current* alliance live from the Albion API every time, and check the registering/purged player against that - there's no separate alliance name to set or keep in sync. If the guild ever switches alliances in-game, registration and purge pick that up automatically on the next run. If the guild currently isn't in any alliance, alliance registration/purge is unavailable until it joins one.

**Bank**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/bank deposit @user <amount>` | Add money to a user's account |
| `/bank withdraw @user <amount>` | Remove money from a user's account |
| `/bank clear @user` | Clear a specific user's balance |
| `/bank clearall` | Clear all balances (use with caution) |

**Content**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/content create` | Create a content callout (ROA/CTA/GCAMPS/FF/Tracking/Avadungeon) |
| `/content reset` | Reset content system for a new callout |
| `/content adduser @user [role]` | Manually add a user to a role slot |
| `/content removeuser [role]` | Remove a user from a role slot |

Content types: **ROA** (Roads of Avalon, 7 roles + fill), **CTA** (tank/heal/dps/support/dtank), **GCAMPS** (5 roles + fill), **FF** (tank/heal/dps), **Tracking** (5 roles + fill), **Avadungeon** (10 roles + fill).

**Regear**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/regear create <type> <title> <time>` | Create a regear thread (CTA or FF) |
| `/regear close` | Close and lock the regear thread |

**Ticket system**

The prefix form mirrors the slash form 1:1 - `/ticket <subcommand>` <-> `!ticket <subcommand>`:

| Command | Slash | Prefix |
|---|---|---|
| Configure a panel | `/ticket setup` | `!ticket setup <panelId> "<name>" <categoryId> <pingRoleId> <staffRoleIds> <approveRoleId> <transcriptChannelId> ["<nicknameFormat>"]` |
| List panels | `/ticket list` | `!ticket list` |
| Post the apply button | `/ticket panel [id]` | `!ticket panel` |
| Delete a panel | `/ticket delete <id>` | `!ticket delete <panelId>` |
| View statistics | `/ticket stats` | `!ticket stats` |
| Health check | `/ticket health` | `!ticket health` |
| Reset all ticket data | `/ticket reset confirm:true` | `!ticket reset confirm` |

The old flat command names (`!ticketsetup`, `!ticketpanels`, `!ticketdelete`, `!ticketstats`, `!tickethealth`, `!applypanel`) still work as aliases.

Example panel setup: `!ticket setup apply "Apply" 123456789012345678 987654321098765432 111111111111111111,222222222222222222 333333333333333333 444444444444444444 "SOUTH | {username}"` (staff role IDs are comma-separated, no spaces; quoted values may contain spaces).

`/ticket reset` / `!ticket reset` **permanently deletes all tickets and transcripts for the server** - both now require explicit confirmation (`confirm:true` / `confirm`), matching `/purge`'s pattern.

Ticket lifecycle: **open** → **claimed** (staff clicked Claim) → **approved** (role + nickname applied) or **closed** (no approval). Data is isolated per guild under `guilds/{guildId}/` - see [Data & Storage](#data--storage).

**Permissions**

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `!prefix <new>` | Change the bot's prefix for this server |
| `/perms list` | View role permissions |
| `/perms add <bank\|cta\|content> @role` | Grant a role permission |
| `/perms remove <bank\|cta\|content> @role` | Revoke a role permission |

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

**Why can't I register?**
Use your exact in-game name (case-sensitive), confirm you're actually in the guild/alliance in Albion, and check you selected the right region.

**How do I change my registered character?**
`/unregister`, then `/register` with the new character. Only one character per Discord account.

**My nickname/role didn't change.**
The bot needs Manage Nicknames / Manage Roles, and its own role must be positioned *above* the role or member being changed in Server Settings → Roles.

**What does a purge do?**
`type:guild` re-checks registered members against the Albion API and removes entries that no longer match; `type:alliance` removes all active alliance registrations and the configured alliance role(s).

**Tickets aren't being created.**
Confirm a panel exists (`!ticketpanels` / `/ticket list`) and the bot has Manage Channels and the category ID in the panel config is correct.

**Slash commands aren't showing up in Discord.**
Run `npm run register` and wait a few minutes for Discord to propagate the change.
